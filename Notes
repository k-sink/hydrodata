                              Impervious surfaces account for less than 20% of total cover. These areas most commonly include large-lot 
                              single-family housing units, parks, golf courses, and vegetation planted in developed settings for recreation, 
                              erosion control, or aesthetic purposes.
22    Developed, Low Intensity - areas with a mixture of constructed materials and vegetation. Impervious surfaces account for 20% to 49% percent of total cover.

                    perennial cycle. Pasture/hay vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of total vegetation.
82    Cultivated Crops - areas used for the production of annual crops, such as corn, soybeans, vegetables, tobacco, and cotton, and also perennial woody 
                        crops such as orchards and vineyards. Crop vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class also includes all land being actively tilled.

Area not matching for some basins between NLCD pixel count and provided value (GAGES II, NWIS)
Used MRLC map viewer to upload shapefile with EPSG 3857 projection and then clipped NLCD raster. 
Resulting pixel counts were the same as those determined using QGIS method clipping full raster to shapefile. 
Areas include NWIS provided drainage area (mi2), CAMELS = GAGESII (sq km), NLCD derived (pixel count * 900 = m2)
Catchment attributes can be directly obtained using R and NLDI from dataRetrieval package

Combined MOPEX and CAMELS gauge values = 1050  (7 of MOPEX gauges are not in GAGESII dataset), check to see omission reasons

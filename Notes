Area not matching for some basins between NLCD pixel count and provided value (GAGES II, NWIS)
Used MRLC map viewer to upload shapefile with EPSG 3857 projection and then clipped NLCD raster. 
Resulting pixel counts were the same as those determined using QGIS method clipping full raster to shapefile. 
Areas include NWIS provided drainage area (mi2), CAMELS = GAGESII (sq km), NLCD derived (pixel count * 900 = m2)
Catchment attributes can be directly obtained using R and NLDI from dataRetrieval package

Add leading zero to gauge id in excel, select cell, format cells, custom, put number of zeroes such as (8) 00000000 to add a leading zero to 7 digit numbers
Find matching IDs between files, highlight the page (copy so both are on the same page), conditional formatting, duplicates, highlight red

Gaugelist.csv with 1050 catchments and whether MOPEX, CAMELS or both (SAME) dataset
Combined MOPEX and CAMELS gauge values = 1050  (7 of MOPEX gauges are not in GAGESII dataset). MOPEX did include gauges with large amounts of missing discharge data.
